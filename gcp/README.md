# Terraform GCP Practice Repository

Welcome to my Terraform GCP Practice Repository! This repository contains various Terraform projects in GCP that I have created. All the projects here are open-source and free to use.

## Overview

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files. This repository showcases my practical experience with Terraform and covers a range of scenarios for deploying and managing cloud resources.

## Projects

Explore the projects available in this repository:

| Project Number | Project Description                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 01             | Simple VM with Network                     |

Each project is contained within its own directory, and you can find the respective `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf` and other files inside each project folder.

## Usage

Feel free to delve into these projects, using them as references or starting points for your own Terraform deployments. Before running any of the projects, make sure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can also configure backends to store your state files remotely, promoting better collaboration and version control.

## Securing Sensitive Information in Terraform Code

When working with Terraform to automate the provisioning of resources and configurations, it's crucial to ensure that sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, is treated with the utmost care and security. While Terraform offers a powerful and efficient way to manage infrastructure as code, it's essential to take steps to protect your personal and confidential data from unauthorized access.

## Extracting Personal Information

In the provided Terraform code, you'll notice that it includes placeholders for usernames, passwords, and other personal details. These placeholders are intended to demonstrate the setup process, but in a real-world scenario, it's highly recommended to extract such sensitive information from the code and manage it securely.

## Best Practices for Handling Sensitive Data

Here are some best practices to consider when handling sensitive information in your Terraform code:

1. **Externalize Secrets**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information directly into the code. Instead, use external secret management tools or services designed to securely store and manage secrets.

2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive values, such as passwords and API keys, as environment variables rather than embedding them in the code. This helps keep your code clean and allows for separation of configuration from sensitive data.

3. **Implement Access Controls**: Limit access to sensitive data within your organization. Only authorized individuals or processes should have access to the stored secrets.

4. **Encryption and Encryption at Rest**: Whenever possible, use encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest. This ensures that even if data is compromised, it remains unreadable without proper decryption.

5. **Audit and Monitoring**: Implement auditing and monitoring practices to track access to sensitive data and detect any unauthorized attempts.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your Terraform code remains secure and compliant with data protection regulations while effectively managing your infrastructure.
