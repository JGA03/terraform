# Terraform Practice Repository

Welcome to my Terraform Practice Repository! This repository contains various Terraform projects that I have created while preparing for the Terraform certification. All the projects here are open-source and free to use.

## Overview

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files. This repository showcases my practical experience with Terraform and covers a range of scenarios for deploying and managing cloud resources.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference or starting point for your own Terraform deployments. Each project has its own directory, and you can find the respective `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf` files inside each project folder.

Before running any of the projects, ensure you have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can also set up backend configurations to store your state files remotely for better collaboration and version control.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome contributions and feedback to make this repository even more valuable for the Terraform community.

## License

All projects in this repository are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as per the terms of the license.

Happy Terraforming! ðŸš€
